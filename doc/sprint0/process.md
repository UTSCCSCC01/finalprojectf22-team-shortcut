# Process
## Team Organization
The team is organized based on the rules and regulations stated in the team contract. For the project itself, we planned to divide work equally so 2 members will work on the front end, 2 on the back end, and the last 2 will work on the database. So far all members are equal in status and power in the team. Some members have his/her own roles and are responsible for their duty. The following are the roles and who are responsible for each role:

    Team lead - Scrum master: Alfred
    Scrum development team member - All of us
    Product owner - Runyu

    Since we are following the three-tiered architecture, we have separated our roles into:
    Front end - Megan and Pintao
    Back end - Chau and Alfred
    Database - Runyu and Caleb

    The following tools are used to help: 
    Jira for project management
    Figma for UI prototypes
    Git for version control
    Google Docs for file sharing
    Discord for discussions and meetings
    

## Decision Making
Each member will talk and share his/her idea/opinion (if any), the rest of the team will listen to it respectfully and express their thoughts on the initial idea/opinion. After discussion, we would follow the golden rule to either reject the idea/opinion, think of new ideas/opinions based on the initial one, or accept the idea/opinion and have that as our decision. Golden rule: if 2 or more members disagree on the idea/opinion then it would be reconsidered. Then if 2 or more members still disagreed on the reconsidered idea/opinion then we will reject it once and for all.


## Defining priority and/or points of user stories
Priority for user stories will be scored 1-5, with 5 indicating the highest priority and 1 the lowest. Our team will use the SCRUM poker to prioritize the user stories. There will be 3 rounds in total to decide the priority for each user story. For our team's criteria of priority, it will be based on each member's personal opinion including the difficulty, velocity, importance, etc. In each round, we will start off from each and all members giving out their score first. Then one by one, each member will explain the reasoning from his/her score. After that we will move onto the next round and repeat the same process. At the end of round 3, all and each member will give out the final score. If we still fail to reach a consensus, then we will take the average (.5 round up) of all the final scores and finalize that average as our priority for the user story.


## Meeting Frequency
We held our first meeting on week 1â€™s Sunday on zoom. Then on week 2 all members of the team met in-person 2 times to work on Sprint 0. Then each week starting from week 3, we have a fixed schedule for meeting as stated in team contract: we will be meeting in-person Wednesday at 5pm, and will be meeting online Tuesday at 4pm, Friday at 3pm, and Sunday at 10am via Discord.


## Lessons to take on this phrase and our next steps
* __Time efficient__: We need to make decisions faster. Furthermore, we need to be less decisive and strictly follow our decision making process. Most importantly, we need to stop questioning and reconsider the decisions that are already made. To do this we should think twice when making decisions and make sure we stay with those decisions.
* __Smoother communication__: All of us need to be honest and don't be afraid to express our true thoughts and feelings. Also, don't stay quiet if there is an opinion/idea that comes to mind.
* __Preparation__: We should come up with a plan before attending our meetings so we know what we will be doing/discussing beforehand.

# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Meeting Details 
- On the 10th of October 2022, we held the sprint 1 retrospective meeting on Discord. During the meeting, group members discussed the practices in sprint 1 and how we will improve in sprint 2. 


## Participants
- Alfred Tze-Hong Ha, Megan Liu, Runyu Yue, Caleb Zhang, Chau, Pintao He


## What are some good practices that you should continue for the next sprint?
- Task breakdown is clear and can be finished independently.
- Meetings are frequent and everyone fully participates.
- Good communication for small tasks in discord.

## What are some harmful practices that you should stop for the next sprint?
- All pull requests to the dev branch are done on the last day of sprint 1, which should be done at least 2 days ahead the end of sprint.
- Connect the frontend and backend too late and bugs occur.
- First commit happened too late which reduced the overall testing time

## What are some new practices that you might want to use for the next sprint?
- Automated testing (?)
- Pull requests should be done early for review and changes if needed.
- Most independent code should be done by the first week of sprint 2.
- Documentation can be used to ensure communication between frontend, backend and database.
- Code Review
- Follow same structure
- Achieve agreement early on universal designs
= More active communication between frontend and backend.

## Release Goal
Release Date: 2022.12.02 (date for presentation)

For our release goal, we plan to build an easy-to-use search tool that focuses on academics for UTSC students. The website aims to have students create accounts with their email addresses to access further features. 

Users will be able to register through email or login with existing accounts. After logging in, they should be able to modify their personal information in the profile, which is optional, and can be set to anonymous. Users have full freedom to decide whether they want to show up themselves on shortcUTSC. Moreover, accounts can be deleted if the user doesn’t want to use them anymore. [SHOR-2, SHOR-3, SHOR-4, SHOR- 22]

The home page will direct users to different features. 
First of all, users can go to Course Search page. It allows users to general search for the desired course, and there is a button that directs to advanced search. The advanced search will have various specifications for users to search with more details. [SHOR-5, SHOR-6] Searching will direct users to the course information page that they are looking for, users can read through the descriptions to understand the contents. Users can rate/comment on this course if they completed it, or they can choose to read other students’ comments to have a general understanding of the course experiences. Users can like/dislike/comment on other students’ previous comments. [SHOR-7, SHOR-9, SHOR-10, SHOR-11, SHOR-13] The average rating will be available to see on the course information page, and users can choose to sort the search results based on this number. [SHOR-8, SHOR-12]

On the Program Search page, the same functionality with course search is available to users. They are able to general and advance search for the desired program. The program information page will have sufficient descriptions for users to consider. [SHOR-16, SHOR-17, SHOR-18]
Users are able to know graduation requirements on the graduation information page. [SHOR-19]

For the users who have trouble with course selection, they can go to the Recommendation page. They will be able to fill out an academic history survey, and shortcUTSC will give out a list of recommended courses based on their preference. [SHOR-14, SHOR-15]
Users can change the website to light/dark mode at any time. [SHOR-21]

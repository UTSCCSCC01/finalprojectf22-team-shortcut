Existing products: UTSC Calendar (https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/)
First of all, UTSC Calendar is a general information site that is available for everyone.
It includes all kinds of information: financial, deadline dates, registration, etc. Our product focuses on academic information with more detailed features for UTSC students only.
For the student users, our product involves course/program searching and info displaying, which helps students to have a better understanding of their academic life. Meanwhile, students can rate and comment on the course that they took, which provides information to the website not limited to formal descriptions. Moreover, students can get recommended by the website on how they should take courses to fulfill the graduation requirements.
Our product includes a better student experience by providing the rating feature and recommendation feature. Students will feel more comfortable and have better knowledge when they go into the course, reducing the possibility of dropping and re-selecting.  
The competitor UTSC Calendar doesn’t have these features, and it would take them to add additional features to the database and implement a new platform for interaction between its users. UTSC Calendar has the feature of searching on various aspects, but it fails to take into account the students’ considerations and hesitations while looking at different courses/programs. Therefore, these are the pros of our product that is competitive.
